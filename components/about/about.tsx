			I'm {myCurrentAge} years old, born in Bulgaria, but a citizen of the world. I am a very communicative,
			open-minded, and good-hearted person. I love reading books, traveling, and being around nature. I always
			strive to help others, and I genuinely believe that if we want to change the world, we should first start

				Everything started in 2016 in a small digital marketing agency. Back then, I thought that digital
				marketing would be the love of my life because of its creativity. Soon our agency started bringing small
				business card websites to its customers, and then I fell in love with programming.

				Meanwhile, I was studying for my bachelor's degree at the University of National and World Economy in
				Sofia and Software Engineering at Softuni. The official university gave me a lot of knowledge about the
				business world, but the academy was the one that taught me how to write code.

				While studying and still working in the digital marketing agency, I began doing freelance projects. I
				have worked with different agencies, tried to build a personal brand, and left dozens of satisfied
				customers. I loved freelance work because of the freedom I've had. Although, I was always responsible
				and correct with my clients.

				I liked how practical and modern the education in Softuni is, and then I decided to become part of the
				biggest programming academy in Bulgaria team. I started as an intern, but soon my passion for FE
				appeared, and I was leading the JavaScript program there. I worked passionately on the FE program
				improvement with an incredible team of five people under my lead.

				And then one of the most incredible things in my career happened. I realized that the more knowledge I
				share, the happier I am. Four years after, with hundreds of students and more than 300+ lectures, I
				couldn't be more proud of this journey.

				At the age of 22, I led a five-person team and conducted lectures in front of more than 300. And yes,
				back then, programming was half of my job, and I felt the need to spend more time doing this to improve
				my technical expertise. That's why I decided to move to the development team in the same company and
				start working behind the educational software we were using.

				After a year and a half and a lot of thoughts like "FE is boring, maybe I should become Full-stack" I've
				met Devexperts. The Fintech domain, combined with really well-written projects using a functional &
				reactive approach, still fills every day with something new to learn. Then I also realized that in this
				moment of my life, I want to work for a big company with well-organized processes and a dedicated person
				for each role (not a fan of a one-man army anymore). Now I'm living my best life in this company, working as a FE team lead with a wonderful team.

				Last but not least is my blogging experience. I'm on a break from teaching because of the pandemic (and
				because I prefer teaching onsite). Although my English is not perfect, I decided to start sharing some
				thoughts about life and programming. Still new to that and still trying to gather more posts before I
				start improving the SEO, so your feedback is kindly welcomed. :)
