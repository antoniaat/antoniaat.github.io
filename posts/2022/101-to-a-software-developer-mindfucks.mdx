Here is the wonderful end of this week, and what we will talk about today is our mindfucks. Of course, not only the software developer has mindfucks, and this can be said for almost every person, but lately, I thought about only mindfucks common among developers. 

## Money, Money, Money

The problem and why I choose to start exactly with this topic is that so many people are scared to talk about that. And because regardless, we're living in an open world, this remains taboo. So many people out there with such different professions are not getting what they deserve. This leads us to the biggest question - What do I deserve?

So what you deserve is not a feeling related to your ego or self-esteem. From a salary perspective, what you deserve can be very easily calculated based on two factors, so please don't rely here on your mommy's opinion that you are the best and should receive more!
* **The first factor is the market** - Please do not ignore the average market salary ranges. Unfortunately, the salary ranges for the developers in Swiss are different from the ones in Bulgaria, and there are many reasons behind that. So if you have a friend working remotely for a Swiss bank or a colleague with the same experience as you working from the UK, don't be jealous! There are many open surveys and statistics that can tell you, based on your position and years of experience, what is the average salary range. One very good one for Bulgaria is [the one posted by DEV.bg](https://dev.bg/digest/zaplatite-v-it-sektora/).
* **Numbers are not everything** - Yes, numbers are important, but you can't rely only on them. The numbers give you the average, but the reality is that you can be much more OR LESS than that. That's why behind every promotion should stand a list of accomplishments. Nobody will give you a promotion just because you have worked in the company for ten years, just like nobody is becoming senior just because three years have passed while he was a middle developer. Be 100% aware of your responsibilities and their completion. Yes, you may think you don't need that because what else should a developer do except write code? Believe there is a lot more. Every company has a different set of responsibilities, but to be a good mid-level developer, you should be able to develop features independently, help others upon request, do code reviews, onboard new people, create reusable solutions, and care about the code quality, to assume end-to-end responsibility of your tickets, to be initiative, etc. So before asking for anything, make sure you have a list of your achievements in the company and that you're covering the expected results 100%. Then you can start singing money, money, money.

## Should I Leave or Should I Stay? The Career Path Dilemma.

One of the hardest decisions ever if it's time to change the company. For IT companies, it is quite common to change companies, but still, I don't know a person who likes to do so often. The biggest mindfuck comes when you have reasons to quit, but you also have reasons to stay. I am sure you've heard things like: 

#### "I realize that my salary is not enough, but I love the team, and they are like my second family."

#### "I know I do a lot of overtime, but I truly believe in the company values. I guess I will sacrifice until I can."

#### "I am not happy with some stuff here, but all the companies are like that. In the end - it's a job."

#### "I am not happy at this company any more, but I don't feel ready to quit. I have a lot of things to do in my personal plan in the next year, so I don't want to deal with a new company."

I suggest you take a list and pen if you have similar thoughts - I have the framework for you. Every person is different, we are going through different life stages, and our values are changing. This exercise is not something you are doing once in your life. The opposite - I can advise you to do this at least once per year. (I am happy to share that the company that introduced me this great framework (Devexperts) is now making this public. Everyone can go to the company's Github Page and download the official template the employees are using).
*Take this list of different aspects in your career (and company) and try to order them from the most important to the least important.*

* **Subject area/ Domain**
* **Technologies you are using**
* **Workflow efficiency**
* **Task complexity level**
* **Relationship with direct manager**
* **Relationship with the team**
* **Possibility to offer ideas and make suggestions**
* **Trainings and education**
* **Quality of interaction with other teams**
* **Professional growth**
* **Career growth**
* **Importance of the work**
* **Level of responsibility, independence in work**
* **Opportunity to prove yourself**
* **Income level**
* **Office/ Workplace equipment**
* **Social package quality - work schedule, medical insurance, etc.**
* **Company reputation & stability**

After that, rate EVERY item in this list with how satisfied you feel from 1 to 5 (5 - I am very satisfied, 1 - not satisfied at all). While doing this exercise, remember to write down your thoughts. For example, if you are filling the workflow efficiency field and can say that you are not satisfied with this, write down what bothers you most. Don't rush this exercise, and take your time to think and write down everything important to you.

Now you have a CLEAR vision and list with your values, and you know which of them your company satisfies and what you are missing. It's much easier to make this decision now, right?


## The Imposter Syndrome or The Fear of Who You Are

I've experienced this syndrome without knowing its name. This software developer mindfuck can appear in different forms, but I will use as an example a specific one here - the public speaking fear. I am not talking about the usual stuff of being frightened by the public. Usually, people with this problem don't want to give technical lectures. That is the fear that you don't understand things enough and someone with a loooot more knowledge than you will come to your lecture and it will ask you the most difficult technical question in the world. Of course, this will never happen. If we are middle developers and we want to talk about what is useEffect in React, our topic probably won't be interesting for people who are "gurus" in React or to FE developers with 10 years of experience. And if they somehow appear to be in our lecture and somehow ask us this complicated technical question, nothing will happen if we say we don't know. This doesn't mean we are not helpful to the rest of the people. And it doesn't mean this is the most stupid lecture, and we should never do it again! Recently I understood that this behavior stands behind the so-called "Imposter syndrome". I've read about it, and I can't say that if you have the fear I described, you definitely have it. But I hope now you will face this fear and realize that it's not enough to stop you from spreading knowledge and encouraging other specialists!

## Unjustified Hustling

A lot has been said about the work-life balance and why we should not spend 90% of our life working, so I will not dive into this. But there is a particular situation where sometimes a developer can be tricked to ruin his balance. I genuinely hope you have not been in this situation and just heard stories about it. Sometimes a company's management can request way too much from the team. The work time will be increasing, and a wave of negative comments will hit people who prefer to leave the office at 6 P.M. When the whole environment becomes so toxic, I realize how hard it can be to say "Goodbye", and I realize how easily people can be tricked and manipulated. Yea, you might sacrifice your personal life but look how vital and valuable work you do for your company. Or yea, you might experience burnout, but your efforts will be paid someday. Or YEA, you might think about quitting but look at all these people like you who are working 24/7 without complaining, and they look fine. I've lived in this scenario and know people who have lived like this for years. What is my opinion about it? No company in the world deserves your time more than your kids, family, and beloved ones.
