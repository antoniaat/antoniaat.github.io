# Take a list and note

Ultimately, your happiness doesn't depend on the company or the people there. The responsibility is yours, and you should realize this. People are changing, the world is changing, you are changing, and this is normal. So you need to "update" your values regularly and be sure you are addressing them to your managers so the company can react and give you what you want. Of course, not every company will do this, but If they are doing it, in my opinion, they appreciate you and care about you. So try to categorize and write down how you feel about the significant aspects of your work. After that, rank them from most important to least important and think if your company is currently satisfying your ambitions:
* **Project Idea/Area** - If you are working in a product company, you don't have much to change here, but usually, outsourcing gives enormous opportunities here. Of course, you can't entirely shift the domain because if you work for a Fintech company, you probably won't have the chance to develop a game or a WordPress website. But you may want to change the project inside to something more interesting. I've been in a situation where I worked on an internal project in my current company: a time tracking system for the employees. One of the main reasons to start in this company was because I was interested in investing, trading and fintech, so working on a non-related project was definitely not enjoyable for me. As soon as I addressed this problem, my managers moved me to another project.
* **Colleagues & Team** - Even though most of us are working remotely, it's vital to be happy with the people you are communicating with and working with daily. Probably if you feel in a toxic environment and don't like the team, your manager will not change the whole team because of you, but at least you will realize this and maybe try to change the project. 
* **Manager/ Team Lead** - Well, in my opinion, this is the most important figure from your colleagues. I've had many different managers, and I can say only a few of them were ready for this position. I wouldn't say I like when someone is in this position just because of the years' experience. Being a leader is a responsibility, and I have many criteria for the person I'm working with (I may list them in another article :D). So be sure you receive regular feedback about your performance and growth from your manager. Make sure that you have the time and freedom to learn and grow. And appreciate it if this person is making efforts to improve your working environment by adding new processes, sharing new propositions, etc.
* **Stability** - I'm still not in a situation where I care about my job stability, but I know I'll probably be someday. Yes, it's cool to be a developer because you have all of these offers on your LinkedIn, but you might feel stressed if there is a chance not to work where you are tomorrow. Even though it's not hard for us to find a new job, admit that you aren't like it if you don't know what will happen tomorrow.
