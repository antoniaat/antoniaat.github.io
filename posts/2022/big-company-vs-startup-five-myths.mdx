Lately, when reading books, watching videos, or just listening to people, I noticed one stereotype I don't like. Maybe you've also heard it. It's about working in a big company, and it may sound like this: "If you want your experience skyrocketing, you should quit the comfortable and well-paid job in your big company and start your own business." or "I am one well-known, and good professional and I've quit my job and Microsoft to start working in a startup. This was the best decision in my life.". The story is almost the same every time, and I don't like how, in our field, it's a prevalent opinion that if you work in a big company, you don't care about your growth. My experience may differ, so I'll try to break this stereotype through my professional experience. 

# Myth #1: Bringing Value 
There is a big myth about the relation between the company size and the value it's bringing. Yes, of course if you put a small start-up that takes care about homelles pets next to a huge bank with 50k employees the first one will bring you the sense of "more value for the society". I believe it's because of the example, so the opposite can be equally valuable. I know developers who quitted their well-paid comfortable jobs just to have the feeling that their effort is appreciated in a more valuable startup and in the end they were not happy because of the chaos and other problems there.
So If you feel that you don't bring any value with your work consider changing it but not for a smaller one but for more valuable one. When going on interviews understand very well on what kind of project you will work on, and think if you like the idea behind it and if you want to give 8h per day for this idea and cause.

# Myth #2: You Learn More When You Do The Work For 10 People
I've been in this situation in one of my previous jobs. Back then I was teaching, writing code, doing social media customer support, organizing external courses, preparing the payment documents at the end of the month, and of course, doing a hundred more administrative tasks. And during this time, I was - wow, that's great because at what other place can you learn how to create a payment contract and Angular application simultaneously? And during these two years, I was entirely sure that I was learning a lot, and this was an excellent opportunity for me. Now I realize the truth. Yes, it was intriguing to do all this stuff, but none of these skills apply to my daily FE life now. Yes, back then it was interesting to see how all these things are happening but now when I don't practice them I forgot most of them. 

# Myth #3: Fast Career Growth 
Some people are saying that the carer growth in a big companies is a total bullshit. Maybe you've heard how many levels of Software Engineers there are in big companies and somehow the bigger the company is the more they are. This means that it will take you a lot of years to go to the top and probably they will have new system then so you will never get it. Of course you can start immediately working as a CTO, Head of Something 
or even CEÐž at some startup. Although, It may be cool to have the CEO experience when you're 22 I'm not sure how this will benefit you. If the business idea is yours and you are spending time and efforts for something you truly believe in I can understand your motivation. Otherwise, I don't find any scence. 

# Myth #4: Be Your Own Boss
I'm definetely not saing that is a bad thing to start your own business. But I truly believe that if the main reason for that is just to be your own boss then it's a very bad idea. The business journey shouldn't be started only because of your ego. Yeah, it may be cool for your ego to have the opportunity to say that you are businessman or you are taking these important decisions but if this is your main motivation it won't give you the all needed strenght to become an entrepeuner. So if some of your friends and familly asks you why you've decided to start your own business and your immediate answer is "Because I want to be my own boss" rethink the whole thing one more time. 

# Myth #5: Freedom
I have worked as a freelancer for some years and I know that people often associate this job with the freedom. It's super cool that you can start the working day at any time and work wherever you are but you usually you don't do this. You still have promises to the clients, deadlines, meetings with them in so on. And most of the times they are the ones who dictate those rules. So usually you stick to the very same routine everyday - you work in the very same hours sitting on your couch. And then this freedom doesn't sound so cool anymore and you start seeing other parts of the job like the bigger responsibility and the fact you need to organize very well your time in order to not dissapoint anyone. 
So people often associate the work in your own business with this freedom but I don't think they are really related. The opposite - the people running their own business work longer hours, under bigger stress and very small percent of them is taking more days for rest than the ones that "we - the ordinary employees" are taking.
