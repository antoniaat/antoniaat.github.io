## "XP is an opportunity to test yourself, to be yourself, to realize that maybe you've been fine all along and just hanging with the wrong crowd"

Before reading this book, I didn't know what extreme programming was. So before going through the main topics listed in this excellent book by Kent Beck, let's first explain what XP is and do you really need to read this book.

**Short answer** - please read this book if you feel your team is not doing things the best way. Read it if you like your colleagues but you don't like the workflow. Read it if you feel that other IT companies are giving much more than yours. Read it if you want to improve something in your work, but you don't know what and how. Read it if you feel overwhelmed with work and don't feel your team's productivity is the most satisfactory. I can list many more reasons, but I think you've got the idea. Although I'm not a person who meets these conditions, I liked the book and learned some things. If I had read this book in the first three years of my career, maybe I wouldn't quit the company because I would know how to fix the things I didn't like.

# But What Extreme Programming Really Is?

I'm far away from the thought of retelling you the book and explaining in detail everything in there. So please excuse me if my definitions are not so descriptive and detailed, but I will try to tell you everything from my perspective.

XP is a methodology and style of working. As I already mentioned, a methodology that can solve many of our daily problems can make our work lives much easier. So without losing more time, let's jump to the main principles this methodology gives us.

## Values

XP's five values are communication, simplicity, feedback, courage, and respect.

* **Communication** - I guess you're not surprised by this. I always thought that since I'm a good communicator, I would never have problems with this during my work. And this is wrong. If the communication in your team is not set correctly, it doesn't matter how good you are. It only matters that you will not discuss things regularly with your team because you don't have the culture of doing so, which will lead to many misunderstandings and pressure inside. I've been in situations where I communicate with the team all the time for non-work-related topics, but when it comes to work, we start arguing and being nervous. That's a sign of lousy communication inside the team.

* **Simplicity** - With each subsequent year of experience, we tend to forget how simple things actually are. I'm sure you've been in situations where developers talk about super complex solutions for something and always forget to ask the question - how can we make this easier?

* **Feedback** - Feedback is crucial for our growth. I'm currently reading "Ego Is the Enemy", and I can share many philosophical thoughts on this topic. I've received feedback in many different forms: one-to-one meetings with my manager, 360 anonymous feedback from colleagues, feedback that I've requested from some people after working with them, recommendations from my ex-colleagues, and so on. 

* **Courage** - It's typical when people don't like something in management, processes, practices, and so on to start commenting on it silently with others. Few people will stand and propose a straightforward solution to the problem in front of everybody. That is also happening in our personal lives. IT'S NOT BETTER to comment on the problems in the coffee breaks with other colleagues and to quit the company after one year. It's much better to have the COURAGE to say something and to solve this problem.

* **Respect** - I often meet this problem in the communication between senior and junior people. I remember situations where, when proposing some technical solution, I've received an answer from my team lead like: "Yeah, you know I'm the senior one, so please keep your ideas for you, and we will use my solution." That shows nothing but disrespect. I also sometimes find myself in a mood where I just want to scream to junior developers because they are asking me the very same questions a hundred times per day, but you know - keep controlling yourself. 

## Practices

The primary practices described by Kent Beck in this chapter are many. Although I can't describe all of them here, let's at least name them: 
Sit Together (how important is to sit and work together with your team), Whole Team (the old idea of cross-functional teams), Informative Workspace (add boards with cards and project-related information in the office space), Energized Work (work only when you feel productive), Pair Programming, Stories, Weekly Cycle (planning), Quarterly Cycle (more planning), Ten-Minute Build (nothing more than that), Continuous Integration, Test-First Programming (or the so-called TDD) and Incremental Design (think about design system).

* **Pair Programming** - I'm not a big fan of reusing this practice, but I can't lie that it helps a LOT for more complex things. We always do pair programming sessions for architectural changes in our team and discuss things together. There is no place for behavior like "I'm the most senior person. I'll decide how to do this".

* **Stories** - Early estimation and good planning are crucial for each project, so I can't miss them. There are many books on the topics, so I will not dive into details. You can take a look at my article about the estimations [here](https://antoniaat.com/blog/predict-the-unpredictable-estimates).
