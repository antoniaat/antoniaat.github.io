A week ago, I dived into one of my development career's most challenging FE tasks. Because of reasons, our team needed to investigate the opportunity of creating a shared library of components between two of our projects. And since the experience is the best learner, I will try to summarize what I've learned during this adventure. 
As every developer, in the beginning, I dived into technical solutions. Of course, after two days of reading the documentation on how to set up things, I understood that this wasn't the right path. First, it's super hard to understand the benefits and drawbacks of using something by reading how to set it up and run some commands. And second - you can't tell if something will meet the desired goal if you don't know what that goal is, right?

Before diving into the technical part is essential to distinguish the team's most important criteria for working in this shared UI kit. That is the time when you need to get up from the laptop, grab a pen, and start thinking. There were two main reasons for us to initiate the creation of this project - to have a dedicated team working on it and to easily export/import the UI components from project 1 to project two since, in the first one, their accessibility was way better.

So the top two priorities for our team were:

* **Dedicated team**  - Having a dedicated team that is going to work on this library excluded all the monorepo approaches. I wish I had thought of that before losing two days of reading blog articles like "Why the monorepo is the best approach for creating a UI-kit." :)

* **Components Sync** - It was not like we had all the components ready to be moved in one folder and to update the usages in both projects. We even didn't know how many visual differences we had between those components, so the number one priority was to have the opportunity to update them easily. Our decision needed to allow us to push/pull a lot of code daily without dealing with versioning problems, conflicts, and manual work.

Of course, we also wanted to keep our build time fast, our initial setup for newcomers easy, the testing coverage up to 100%, and so on. And when you give everything from yourself and write down all your ideas, what is the next step? To involve the team! I've created a quiz where I included all of my suggestions and asked the team to participate. After the vote, I was 100% sure what this library should give us and what are the most important criteria for choosing it.

Now let's build our decision matrix. We already mentioned our top two priorities: having a dedicated team working on the library and easy components sync & updates. We will add two more options to it - build time & company-wide UI kit. The second one means that we have the ambitions to use this library for more than two projects and develop it into a company-wide UI kit.

# Git Submodules

Having a limited time to investigate unlimited opportunities for building the tool you need it's not an easy job. The first and most famous solution that comes to our mind, of course, was Git Submodules. Although it is a well-known tool, 99% of the blog articles I found on the subject were useless. They were useless not because they are not well-described or not on the topic but because I was not searching for how to set up Git Submodules but what are the benefits and drawbacks of using them. Of course, you need to know how something works before thinking if it solves your problem, so let's start with that.Of course you need to know how something works before thinking if it's going to solve your problem, so let's first start with that.

First, we need to create a new repository for our shared library. This repository will require initial setup, installing the needed tools, tests integration, storybook, and so on. After we are ready with some of the major components (i.e., when we have something to share), we need to make this repository a submodule of our projects. Let's say that we have projects X and Y. In many articles on the internet, you will find how easy the submodule setup is. You should run `submodule add repoUrl`, and you are done. What Git is doing is cloning this repository into your project directory (just like a copy-paste that you can do on your own :)). The fun part comes after that. When you add a repository as a submodule, you are adding a reference to a particular commit in that repo. So, if someone updates the button component in the shared library and pushes that code, we need to manually update and fetch the new button version into our codebase. And this happens whenever there is a new update.

The other thing I was interested in was can I update the button component from the directory of project X. The short answer here is - no. You can modify the button component only if you are under the shared library repository and its branches. Yes, it can be easier for you to update your button behavior while seeing it integrated into some of the pages, but simply Git Submodules would not allow you to do it.

A favorite approach that I find being in such a situation was to ask another developer for their experience with this technology. I have worked on many projects & teams, and I'm still in most channels and groups where the communication is. So posting a simple message like "Hey, has anybody used Git Submodules?" was a good shot. For 15 minutes talk with a developer who has worked with this, I learned more about three days of chaotic reading on the internet.

So summarizing what I needed to know about Git Submodules was:

* **Well Supported** - It's an old technology, and you can find a solution to almost every problem you will face while using it.
   
* **Initial Setup** - The initial setup it's super easy & no heavy setup for the newcomers to the project.
   
* **Components Sync** -  If you need a regular update to your components, you will find yourself in the circles of hell. You will need to run constantly Git updates and synces, and of course, sometimes, when you forget, you will deal with a messy project.
   
* **Automation** - Probably your first thought is, "But I can automate this." Don't rely on this because when dealing with different git repositories, branches & versions, the automation it's not so easy. You can add some commands to your pipelines that can help you, but you will surely not get rid of the whole mess.
   
* **Build Time** - Unfortunately, I didn't find any resources for the build time when using Git Submodules. Usually, the pipelines are volatile, so you can choose how to configure them. You might want to add automatic update & build on the submodule when building the main repo or ignore it in order to keep the build time fast. 
   
## Decision Matrix - Git Submodules

# Git Subtree

As most of the blog article titles are "Git Subtree: The Git Submodules alternative" (or the Git Subtree documentation pretty clear points), I decided to take a closer look at the second technology on my list. Knowing the basics of Git Submodules, you can easily compare the effort for the primary operations. I liked this cheatsheet which demonstrates the most trivial git commands for both.

It looks like Git Subtree is designed to solve the same problem as Git Submodules, but without being so complicated to use. It's basically like copy-pasting another repo into a folder in your project and just checking it in as though it were your code. So the first and most significant difference between them is that Subtrees are much easier to contribute. That means that it's much easier to do everything that you are going to do with Git. But you know - with freedom comes responsibility. Using Git Subtree, you can easily mess up the directories and updates, so I suggest creating a strict process before dealing with Git Subtrees. By this, I mean that you and your team should sit together and discuss the approach to updating and improving that shared code. After you are on the same page, you can proceed with the development part.

Another common difference you will find on the internet is that Submodule is a link, and Subtree is a copy. That means that Git Subtree makes a copy of your repository without keeping all these references. And if you do not mark them somehow, your repositories are not connected. So if you have a shared components library, a sub-directory in another repo, with Git Subtree, you have two fully separated repositories without any connection.

Let's simulate two very possible situations while working on our case. We have a shared components repository (Project Shared), and we want to use it in 2 of our projects. Thanks to Git Subtree, we have this Project Shared in both repos.

Now imagine that we never talked with our team about the process of committing, and we want to do some updates on the button component. We do our changes while at the Proj X repository and commit them from there. Git Subtree allows you to do this without any problems. That would make you think your changes will also be applied in the Shared repository. Unfortunately, this is not going to happen. As we said, the repositories are not connected, so the changes will stay there when we commit in the /shared directory from Project 1. Now imagine that your colleague is doing the same from Proj Y.

Ultimately, we must use the same approach, choosing Submodules or Subtree. We will have a separate repository and need to commit our updates from there. After that, we will need to sync our project repos. What will be the difference then? With Submodules, the workflow will be much more complicated.

Finally, let's take a look at our decision matrix for Git Subtree:

* **Components Sync** - It's still not the perfect tool for regularly updating the repository, but it's much better than Submodules. If you choose this solution, you can make some automation efforts to make it work better.
    
* **Build Time** - The build time will be worse because, in Subtrees, you don't have references to specific commits but a clear copy-paste of the code. That means that to build Proj 1, you will also need to build everything in the subdirectories.
    
* **Support** - Git Subtree it's not an official part of Git, but it's an old tool, and you can find a lot of questions and information about it. 
    
* **Setup** - The setup requires you to write one line of code, so we can assume that it's super easy and you don't need to learn anything new.

# Git X-Modules

And with the end comes our most sexy solution. Git X-Modules is the best of both worlds. It's making the shared code super easy to maintain, and their free version offers one sync per hour for an unlimited amount of public repositories. Their website has straightforward videos of how it works, so I will not lose your time with this. Just go there and check it out. After verifying that our Bitbucket Version is supported and maintained, I came up with the following decision matrix about Git X-Modules:

* **Support** - Generally, everything is perfect except the tool stability. I've already asked a question in their forum, and the support team quickly answered me. Maybe if our project was smaller or not, depending on the client's wishes, we could give it a chance.

So after having the needed information for all of the technical solutions, let's look at our decision matrices one more time and choose "the one".
