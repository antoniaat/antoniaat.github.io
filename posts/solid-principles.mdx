<p>Sure that I'm aware that there are a thousand articles about the SOLID principles. </p>
Nevertheless, when I'm learning something new I always like to go through different points of view.

I've heard about SOLID in one of my first programming courses. Back then I remember what I was thinking: "First, let me learn to code, and after that I will care about the quality of the written.". Years later, and work through many different projects and I got into the state where the quality of code it really matters.

## First of all, let's break some myths about the SOLID principles:

1. This is not something you need to learn by hard. The idea is just to understand them and when you are qualified enough - to try writing code without breaking them.
2. You need them only for the interviews. Yes, the SOLID principles are something regularly asked in the interviews. The reason of that is because they are fundamental knowledge required for every developer with more than a year of professional experience.
3. You need to understand or write certain languages for following them.

Single Responsibility Principle
Most of the time the developers are assuming that this principle is about an item that should do just one thing. That it's a good principle, but it's not part of the SOLID principles.

The SRP (Single Responsibility Principle) has been described this way:
"A module should have one and only one reason to change."

But what does it mean? Usually, when we are writing code we are doing it based on some requirements. And these requirements are given by different people.
Let's imagine that we are working on an educational system that needs to provide us with information about student courses, payments, and certificates. So our Student class will have the following methods:
