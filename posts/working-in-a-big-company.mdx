Lately, when reading books, watching videos, or just listening to people, I noticed one stereotype I don't like. Maybe you've also heard it. It's about working in a big company, and it may sound like this: "If you want your experience skyrocketing, you should quit the comfortable and well-paid job in your big company and start your own business." or "I am one well-known, and good professional and I've quit my job and Microsoft to start working in a startup. This was the best decision in my life.". The story is almost the same every time, and I don't like how, in our field, it's a prevalent opinion that if you work in a big company, you don't care about your growth. My experience may differ, so I'll try to break this stereotype through my professional experience.

# Myth #1: It's the Company's Responsibility to Make Me Happy

Ultimately, your happiness doesn't depend on the company or the people there. The responsibility is yours, and you should realize this. People are changing, the world is changing, you are changing, and this is normal. So you need to "update" your values regularly and be sure you are addressing them to your managers so the company can react and give you what you want. Of course, not every company will do this, but If they are doing it, in my opinion, they appreciate you and care about you. So try to categorize and write down how you feel about the significant aspects of your work. After that, rank them from most important to least important and think if your company is currently satisfying your ambitions. You can find a guide for this long and satisfying process here.

# Myth #2: You Learn More When You Are Doing The Work For 10 People

I've been in this situation. In one of my previous jobs, I was teaching, writing code, doing social media customer support, organizing external courses, preparing the payment documents at the end of the month, and of course, doing a hundred more administrative tasks. And during this time, I was - wow, that's great because at what other place can you learn how to create a payment contract and Angular application simultaneously? And during these two years, I was entirely sure that I was learning a lot, and this was an excellent opportunity for me. Now I realize the truth. Yes, it was intriguing to do all this stuff, but none of these skills apply to my daily FE life now.
